TODO list for Ach

* TODO Return ACH_MISSED_FRAME from kernel-space
* TODO Test message transmission under heavy concurrency
  - Create c channels, p publishers, c subscribers, and i interrupters
  - Publishers generate random messages, append a checksum, send to
    all channels
  - Subscribers get messages from all channels, and check the checksum
    - Get messages via ach_get() next/last and poll()
  - Interrupters randomly signal publishers and subscribers
  - Test user, kernel, and anonymous channels
* TODO Test for resource leaks
  - See kmemleak
  - open/close seem fine
  - init (upstart) memory consumption grows with repeated device
    creation and unlinking.  Probably an upstart bug.
