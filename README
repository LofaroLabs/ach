* OVERVIEW *
************

Ach is an Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism and library. It
is especially suited for communication in real-time systems that
sample data from physical processes. Ach eliminates the Head-of-Line
Blocking problem for applications that always require access to the
newest message. Ach is efficient, robust, and formally verified. It
has been tested and demonstrated on a variety of physical robotic
systems. Source code for Ach is available under an Open Source
BSD-style license.

****************
* INSTALLATION *
****************

`./configure && make && make install'

See the INSTALL file for details.

*********************
* Example and Usage *
*********************

- Example Code: ./src/ach-example.c
- Shell Tool `ach': can be used to create channels:
  - Create a channel `ach -C CHANNEL_NAME'
  - Delete a channel `ach -U CHANNEL_NAME'
  - Display channel stats `ach -D CHANNEL_NAME'
  - View options `ach -H'

****************
* Formal Model *
****************

Ach has been formally verified using the SPIN model checker.  This
formal model is included in the sourc distribution under the ./spin/
directory.

**************************
* Performance/Benchmarks *
**************************

To evaluate the performance of ach on your machine, you can use the
included `ach-bench' program to test messaging latency.  See the shell
script `src/run-benchmarks' which runs the benchmark with a variety of
options.
