OVERVIEW
========
Ach is an Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism and library. It
is especially suited for communication in real-time systems that
sample data from physical processes. Ach eliminates the Head-of-Line
Blocking problem for applications that always require access to the
newest message. Ach is efficient, robust, and formally verified. It
has been tested and demonstrated on a variety of physical robotic
systems. Source code for Ach is available under an Open Source
BSD-style license.

INSTALLATION
============
    ./configure && make && make install

Alternatively, if you are using Debian or Ubuntu, you can use the golems.org APT repo.

1. Add the following to /etc/apt/sources:

    http://code.golems.org/debian squeeze golems.org

  (substitute the codename for your distribution in place of squeeze,
  e.g. wheezy, precise)

2. `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libach-dev ach-utils`

See the INSTALL file for details.

Example and Usage
=================
* Example Code: `./src/ach-example.c`
* Shell Tool `ach`: can be used to create channels:
  * Create a channel `ach -C CHANNEL_NAME`
  * Delete a channel `ach -U CHANNEL_NAME`
  * Display channel stats `ach -D CHANNEL_NAME`
  * View options `ach -H`

Formal Model
============
Ach has been formally verified using the SPIN model checker.  This
formal model is included in the source distribution under the `./spin/`
directory.

Performance/Benchmarks
======================
To evaluate the performance of ach on your machine, you can use the
included `achbench` program to test messaging latency.  See the shell
script `src/run-benchmarks` which runs the benchmark with a variety of
options.

Improving Real-Time on Linux and i386/amd64
-------------------------------------------
* Disable CPU power-saving from BIOS
* Use the PREEMPT_RT kernel patch
* Disable USB and use a PS/2 keyboard
* Give the 'quiet' flag on the kernel command line
* Try disabling hyperthreading (may not help much)
