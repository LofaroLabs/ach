* OVERVIEW *
************

Ach is a new Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism and
library. It is uniquely suited for coordinating perception, control
drivers, and algorithms in real-time systems that sample data from
physical processes. Ach eliminates the Head-of-Line Blocking problem
for applications that always require access to the newest message. Ach
is efficient, robust, and formally verified. It has been tested and
demonstrated on a variety of physical robotic systems. Finally, the
source code for Ach is available under an Open Source BSD-style
license.

****************
* INSTALLATION *
****************

`./configure && make && make install'

See the INSTALL file for details.

*********************
* Example and Usage *
*********************

- Example Code: ./src/ach-example.c
- Shell Tool `ach': can be used to create channels:
  - Create a channel `ach -C CHANNEL_NAME'
  - Delete a channel `ach -U CHANNEL_NAME'
  - Display channel stats `ach -D CHANNEL_NAME'
  - View options `ach -H'

****************
* Formal Model *
****************

Ach has been formally verified using the SPIN model checker.  This
formal model is included in the sourc distribution under the ./spin/
directory.
