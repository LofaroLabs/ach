Ach 1.0.1
=========

* Add ACH_DEFAULT_CLOCK symbol, set to CLOCK_MONOTONIC if available
* Debian packaging uses debconf to configure inetd

Ach 1.0.0
=========

* Removal of deprecated alternatives to ach_get()

* Change of default condition variable clock from CLOCK_REALTIME to
  CLOCK_MONOTONIC
  - Callers can pass an absolute time value to ach_get() to limit the
    amount of time spent waiting for a new message.
  - Two values are added to ach_create_attr_t to allow setting
    alternate clocks during channel creation (including CLOCK_REALTIME
    if so desired).
  - Rationale for the change:
    + Despite the name, CLOCK_REALTIME is not suitable for Real-Time
      applications.  CLOCK_REALTIME typically gives a "Wall" time in
      UTC.  This value is discontinuous.  It may be reset by:
      - The operator
      - The NTP daemon
      - Leap seconds, where UTC is /defined/ as discontinuous (see TAI for
        a less bizarre alternative).
    + CLOCK_MONOTONIC is monotonic, advancing from an arbitrary initial
      time (e.g. system power-on).  For applications that need to do
      something periodically, CLOCK_MONOTONIC is more suitable.
    + Since Ach is intended for Real-Time control, where strict periodic
      execution is important, CLOCK_MONOTONIC seems to be a better
      default.
