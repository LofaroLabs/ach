/** \mainpage ACH IPC Library
 *
 * Ach is a library that provides a publish-subscribe or message-bus
 * form of IPC.
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 *
 * A tutorial-style manual is available at
 * http://golems.github.com/ach/manual
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Ach differs from other message passing transports with regard to
 * head of line blocking.  In ach, newer messages always supersede old
 * messsages, regardless of whether or not a subscriber has seen the
 * old message.  Old messages will never block new messages.  This
 * behavior is suited to real-time systems where a subscriber is
 * generally interested only in the latest version of a message.
 *
 * Clients may be publishers and or subscribers. Publishers they push
 * data to channels, and subscribers can then poll or wait on the
 * channels for data.
 *
 * Ach deals only with byte arrays.  Any higher level data
 * organization (records, dictionaries, etc) must be handled in the
 * client application.
